###Bowling Challenge

The implementation should use "vanilla" JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks).

__Minimum (keep in mind the optional requirements):__

 * Implement a scoring system for a bowling game according to these rules:

  - A game consists of 10 frames.
  - In general each frame has 2 rolls.
  - In general a player scores the number of pins knocked down.
  - If the player knocks down all 10 pins on the first roll it’s a strike. The player scores 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next two rolls.
  - If the player knocks down all 10 pins in two rolls it’s a spare. The player scores 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next roll.

* Simple visualisation of the game.

__Optional:__

* Add support for the last frame in the game:
 - The player gets additional rolls in the last frame: one additional for a spare after the second roll or two extra rolls for a strike.
* Create a method that randomly throws a roll (one roll is 1-10 pins knocked down), and progresses the scoring.
* Support multiple players.
* Or anything fun you can think of :)
